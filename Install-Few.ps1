#Requires -Version 5.1

.SYNOPSIS
    Installs the 'few' Python script tool.
.DESCRIPTION
    Clones the 'few' repository, creates an installation directory,
    moves the script, and adds the directory to the user's PATH.
.NOTES
    Requires Git to be installed and available in the PATH.
    Requires PowerShell 5.1 or later.
    You might need to restart PowerShell/Explorer/Windows for PATH changes to take full effect.
    This script assumes 'few.py' will be run using Python. Ensure Python is installed
    and you can run Python scripts from your terminal. You might run it as 'python few'
    or associate .py files (or files without extensions) with Python.
